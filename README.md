## Fluent Page Object Pattern in Automated Testing

* More efficient usage and improved readability are achievable through the incorporation of the Page Objects with Fluent API. The result will be Fluent Page Objects or Fluent Page Object Pattern.

Fluent Interface 
Definition

In software engineering, a fluent interface (as first coined by Eric Evans and Martin Fowler) is an implementation of an object-oriented API that aims to provide the most readable code.A fluent interface is typically implemented by using method cascading (concretely method chaining) to relay the instruction context of a subsequent call (but a fluent interface entails more than just method chaining).
* The context is defined through the return value of a called method-self-referential, where the new context is equivalent to the last context.
* Self-referential, where the new context is equivalent to the last contest terminated by the return of a void context.
*Terminated by the return of a void context.
